Functions to extract data from statistical websites and organize them as panel data.

We reported a set of python functions to download data from different sources, in order to speed up accademic researches.<br/>

The python codes work with dynamic websites and are optimized for firefox. Selenium (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) and geckodriver (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) packages are needed. <br/>
I reccomend Spyder (https://pypi.org/project/spyder/) if you are looking for a simple IDE to manage the data,  <br/>
