Functions to extract data from statistical websites and organize them as panel data.

We reported a set of python functions to download data from different sources, in order to speed up accademic researches.<br/>

The python codes work with dynamic websites and are optimized for firefox. The installations of selenium (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) and geckodriver (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) are needed. <br/>
If you want to use different browser, please download and install the different packages, following selenium instructions.  <br/>
If you are looking for a simple IDE to manage the data, use Spyder (https://pypi.org/project/spyder/) <br/>
